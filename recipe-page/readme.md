### The challenge

**My app allows users to:**

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Continued development

This was my third project with Svelte, and I'm very pleased with the outcome. This time, I tried to learn new things, so I started playing around with the looping functionalities in HTML. For example, to render the items of the list, I used the following code:

```
{#each Ingredients as Ingredients}
  <li class="flex gap-7 items-center ml-2">
    <span class="w-1 h-1 rounded-full bg-primary-dark-raspberry"> </span>
    <span>{Ingredients}</span>
  </li>
{/each}
```

I intend to continue exploring and learning more about this technology, so there will definitely be more projects with it coming soon.
