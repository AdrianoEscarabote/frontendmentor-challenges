## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework
- Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets [oficial site](https://sass-lang.com/) 
- JavaScript

### Continued development

It was very interesting to do this project, I believe I did a good job, but I still need to review a little bit about classes in js, it will be the next thing I'll study!
