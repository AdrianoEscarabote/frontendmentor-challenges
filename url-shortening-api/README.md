## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets [oficial site](https://sass-lang.com/) 
- JavaScript
- Fetch API
- Webpack5
- Babel

### Continued development

This was an amazing project, I'm proud to have done everything the front-end mentor was asking for, I had some difficulties during the development of the project, and some very annoying bugs appeared, but I managed to solve them all and I'm much more confident. I'm looking forward to being able to carry out more projects that are really challenging and take me out of my comfort zone, it's in those moments that I learn the most!
