### The challenge

**My app allows users to:**

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Continued development

A simple Angular project. It had been a while since I last developed with it, so I decided to put into practice some of what I remembered. I really enjoy developing with Angular, even though it's one of the frameworks I find most challenging to work with and keep the code organized. It still remains a good framework, and I'm looking forward to trying out the new features.
