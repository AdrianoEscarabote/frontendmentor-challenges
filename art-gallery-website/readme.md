## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Interact with location map with custom location pin, made with [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) - JS library

### Continued development

It was a lot of fun to do this challenge, especially when developing the map, I was a little unsure of how I would build it, but with patience I continued reading the [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) documentation and I think I did great job, looking forward to more challenges!!
