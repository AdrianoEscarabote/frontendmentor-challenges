## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework
- Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets [oficial site](https://sass-lang.com/) 
- JavaScript

### Continued development

This was my first project with burguer menu, I only used sass and js to develop it. I was able to manipulate the elements to make the dropdowns, and I felt comfortable doing the project. This week I managed to improve my skills a lot by manipulating the DOM with js, I'm very happy with the result and my performance!
