## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I was having doubts about how to use the `addEventListener` method in a variable that contained more than one element of the same type, with this one I managed to solve the problem!

```js
btns.forEach(rate => {
    rate.addEventListener('click', () => {
        res.innerHTML = rate.value
    })
})
```

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills a lot using javascript, but with this challenge, I realized that I've already improved a lot.
