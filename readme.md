## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets [oficial site](https://sass-lang.com/) 

### Continued development

It was a lot of fun doing this layout using mobile first, and a lot faster too.

It was a great project to practice bootstrap.
