## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Switch between dark mode and light mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Media queries

### Continued development

I really enjoyed doing this project, there were some parts that I had some doubts about how I was going to position the background images, but I think I did well. However, I think my css codes are longer, I'm thinking about starting to do these challenges with some framework.

### Useful resources

- [Transiotining Gradients](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/eRbLWP) - This helped me to make the body hover and transition effect when the theme is changed.
