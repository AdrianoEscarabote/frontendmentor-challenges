## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets [oficial site](https://sass-lang.com/) 
- JavaScript
- JSON

### What I learned

This was a great project to practice organizing my code using `ES Modules`. I was also able to train how to dynamically get data from the `JSON` file, that is, if the file is changed and updated with some other notification, when the page refreshes we will have another notification!, I still don't know how to make a back-end application to send data for `JSON`, but it would be cool to see it working!
