### The challenge

**My app allows users to:**

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day‚Äôs bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device‚Äôs screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Continued development

I'm quite pleased with the outcome of this project. I managed to handle the JSON data in a simple way, and I feel like I'm on the right track. I'm looking forward to larger projects.
