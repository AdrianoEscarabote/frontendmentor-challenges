## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets [oficial site](https://sass-lang.com/) 
- JavaScript
- Fetch API
- Webpack5
- Babel

### Continued development

This was my first project consuming an API, I learned a lot of things, but I feel that I need to study a little more about it, that is, my next projects will have API integration, after all I need to practice and learn a little more about it!
