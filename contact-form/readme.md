## Overview

### The challenge

**My app allows users to:**

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


### Continued development

I am happy with the outcome of this project. It had been a while since I last developed with Vue, so I decided to put into practice what I remembered. I also took the opportunity to explore new aspects, such as building a form. I believe I did well, successfully developing a form and using Vitest for the first time without much difficulty.
